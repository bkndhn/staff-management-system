# Instructions to clear service worker cache

After deploying, users should:

1. Visit the deployed site
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Application tab > Service Workers
4. Click "Unregister" on any registered service workers
5. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
6. Clear browser cache

This will remove the cached broken version.
